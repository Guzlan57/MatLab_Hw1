% a) Create a variable `radius` and assign it a value of 5.
r = 5 % Radius of Circle
% b) Calculate the area of a circle with this radius and store it in a variable called `area`.
% Calculations of Area
a = ... %Area of Circle
% c) Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in a variable called `circumference`.
%Calculating the Circumference of the Cirlce
c = ... % Circumference of Circle
% d) Display the results with appropriate labels.
% Displaying Results to User
fprintf("For a Circle of radius %f", r)
fprintf("The area is %f \n", a)
fprintf("The Circumference is %f \n", c)
